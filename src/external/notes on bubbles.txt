Bubble-down:
insert p = (x,y):

initialize node v to be root
let vi be child of v whose x-range includes p (find_child(root,p))..
identify at most B points in the Y-set Y(vi) = query(vi_range, -inf) on Qv
if size of the result >= B/2 and p is below all of them then recursively insert in vi
otherwise p joins Y-set Y(vi) and inserted in query structure
if Y(vi) now contains more than B points then the lowest of these points are removed from Qv and recursively inserted in vi
if v is a leaf then p is inserted into the correct position in Lv

Bubble-up:
Reorganization of query data structure on splits (v splits into v' and v''): promotion from aux of v' into aux of parent(v)
find the top most point p' in v' by degenerate query to Qv'.
delete p' from Qv' and insert in Qparent(v).
this may cause the Y-set where p' was taken from to be too small. ergo recurse on that
